-  COMPANY CAN REGISTRATION IN THEIR OWN CURRENCY: It will be possible to Use currency depending on the country. There wont be any compulsion to use standard currencies only.
-  While registering, we will take 5% of the product's cost as fee for using our platform. 

## üí∏Applications

The application of a Fake Products Identification System using blockchain technology has numerous real-world use cases across various industries. Here are several applications where such a system could be implemented:

- Processed Food Items:Your ultimate dining companion!Effortlessly identify any food product with precision and ease using our cutting-edge system. With instant access to detailed information including ingredients, nutritional values, and allergens, make informed decisions and discover new flavors confidently. Say goodbye to guessing games and hello to a seamless culinary journey¬†with¬†Us.

- Cosmetics: Unveil the truth behind your cosmetic choices by ensuring they originate from the genuine source. Embrace the confidence that comes with verified products, promising you a radiant and glamorous allure. Let your beauty shine, backed by the assurance¬†of¬†authenticity

- Clothes: Walk in style, knowing each piece is genuine, bringing you the latest fashion with the confidence of verification. Elevate your wardrobe, embrace¬†originality.

- Medicines and Pharmaceuticals:  
Identifying fake medicines offers key advantages: safeguarding public health, ensuring treatment efficacy, preventing adverse reactions, maintaining trust in healthcare, reducing economic losses, and combating organized crime.

Overall, the application of a Fake Block Identification System using blockchain technology has the potential to enhance authenticity verification across a wide range of industries, providing stakeholders with a secure and transparent way to verify the authenticity of goods, documents, and identities.

MONETISATION: 

Monetizing a Fake Block Identification System using blockchain technology involves offering services or solutions related to authenticity verification for a fee. Here are several monetization strategies for such a system:

1. A total of 5% is taken from the products cost. This is will be a part of the registration and usage fee. No separate fees will later be taken. 

2. **Subscription-based Services**: Offer subscription plans for businesses or individuals to access the authentication services provided by the system. Different tiers of subscription can be offered, each providing varying levels of features and authentication capabilities.

3. **Transaction Fees**: Charge a small fee for each transaction or verification request processed by the system. This could be a per-transaction fee or a percentage-based fee on the value of the transaction.

 4. **Blockchain-based Tokens **: Introduce a blockchain-based token or cryptocurrency that powers the Fake Block Identification System. Users can purchase tokens to access authentication services or participate in the ecosystem, with the potential for token appreciation over time.

By leveraging these monetization strategies, a Fake Block Identification System using blockchain technology can generate revenue while providing valuable authenticity verification services to businesses and individuals across various industries.

## üõ†Project Setup
- STEP 1: Install Node.js and npm: Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It allows developers to build server-side applications in JavaScript and run them on the server. It includes a rich library of modules, known as npm (Node Package Manager), that enables developers to add functionality to their applications quickly and easily. It is widely used for web application development, building networked applications, and developing server-side scripts.
- STEP 2: Install Metamask Extension MetaMask is a browser extension and mobile app that provides an interface for interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to securely store, manage, and send Ethereum and other Ethereum-based tokens, as well as interact with dApps in a user-friendly way.
- STEP 3: Configure a Metamask Account
- STEP 4: Navigate to the repository and clone it: Clone our GitHub Respository
