## üí∏Applications

Pecunia was introduced to address challenges among three key stakeholders: startups, businesses, and students. Our primary objective was to facilitate the seamless operations of these entities within their respective industries. In building this website, we carefully considered the funding needs to support startups with innovative ideas, as well as companies seeking to engage with emerging talent. Likewise, we aimed to connect students with opportunities to contribute their skills and expertise to forward-thinking businesses. Through our platform, we endeavor to foster collaboration and mutual benefit among these diverse participants. Yes, this can be monetized if all parties involved are in agreement.
